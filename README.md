# Eclipse Marketplace Client API v2 OpenAPI Specification
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EclipseFdn/marketplace-rest-api-specs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EclipseFdn/marketplace-rest-api-specs)

The Eclipse Marketplace provides thousands of plug-ins, solutions, and service offerings for the the Eclipse community.
